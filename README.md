# Random-group-generator

Random separation of students in groups

I wrote those two scripts as a first project undertaken in the framework of my professional training to become a Developer. (SIMPLON School). We worked in teams, hence, a random separation of students was an excellent way to build teams to work together.

The first one is written in JavaScript, html, CSS, hence will work in the navigator as an application to divide a group randomly. This was a true introduction to programming in Javascript.

The second script is in Python, which I felt more comfortablle with. The program is structured in class.
